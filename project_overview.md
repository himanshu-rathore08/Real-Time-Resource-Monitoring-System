1️⃣ Project Title

Real-Time System Resource Monitoring System

2️⃣ Introduction

Modern computer systems and servers are required to operate continuously while handling multiple processes and applications. Monitoring system resources such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk space is essential to maintain system stability and performance. Without proper monitoring, systems may experience performance degradation or unexpected failures.

This project focuses on developing a Real-Time System Resource Monitoring System that continuously observes system resources and generates alerts and logs to help detect potential issues before they become critical.

3️⃣ Problem Statement

In many environments, system resource usage is not actively monitored, leading to:

Sudden system slowdowns

Application crashes

Disk space exhaustion

Late detection of performance issues

Manual monitoring is inefficient and unreliable. Therefore, an automated system is required to monitor system resources in real time and provide timely alerts and logs.

4️⃣ Objectives of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:

To continuously monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage

To detect abnormal resource usage conditions

To generate alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded

To maintain logs for performance analysis and troubleshooting

To implement an industry-level monitoring approach using advanced Python concepts

5️⃣ Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

Monitoring resources on a local system

Command-line based execution

File-based logging and alert generation

Continuous real-time monitoring

The project does not include graphical dashboards or cloud-based monitoring in its current version.

6️⃣ Real-World Applications

This system can be used in:

Server and system administration

DevOps and IT operations

Performance monitoring of production systems

Early detection of system failures

7️⃣ Conclusion

The Real-Time System Resource Monitoring System addresses the need for proactive system monitoring by providing continuous observation of key system resources. By generating alerts and logs, the system helps improve reliability, prevent failures, and support informed decision-making in real-world computing environments.
